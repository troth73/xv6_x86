  "xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
   Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
   but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C."

The original upstream branch (mirror) was pulled from the git repository
https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6_x86

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
