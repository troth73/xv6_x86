The xv6_x86 code is based on xv6 and it is intended to be used as a basis for studying operating systems rather than making a real system for production use.

>>>>   "xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix\
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,\
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C."
